# CSS

Cascading style sheet

CSS is mainly use for styling web pages
We can declare CSS in 3 ways

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS


# External CSS
> It is a single which can be use for styling the entire
 web site
> We can use external CSS file to create them or to define
  common style classes which we want to use in the entire
  website
> we can create a file with extension .css

# Internal CSS
> It is use to style a specific web page for eg Home, 
  contact
> In internal css we decalre all css classes in the 
  <style> tag under <head> 

# Inline CSS
> It is use to style any specific html element individually
> we can declare style while writing Html 


We can override external css with internal css
and override internal css with inline css
the maximum importance is givin to the css which is
closest to the html element


Inline > Internal > External
